# P4 | WLA Blog with Administration

## Summary

The purpose of this application is to provide administrator's of the 'WLA' company to log in, and then have the ability to log in to the administration section of the site, create new blog post(s), edit previous post(s), and delete blog post(s). Standard 'guest' users will only have access to the blog, where they have the ability to read the posts from the WLA administrators.

Future functionality will allow guest users to comment on posts, which will pend authorization from a user with administrative priveledges.
